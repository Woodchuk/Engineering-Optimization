# Engineering-Optimization
Using Fenics, GMSH and SciPy to optimize engineering structures
This files will run directly on a multiprocessing system with Fenics 2019.1.0, OpenMPI, SciPy and GMSH4.* installed.
This program optimizes the feedpoint placement and length of a patch antenna for feedpoint impedance match using SciPy
Nelder-Mead optimization (SimplePatch2.py) or Powell optimization (SimplePatchPowell.py).
